# ML-TASK-3
# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Sentiment Analysis

## 🚀 Objective
Predict stock price movements by analyzing the sentiment from financial news and social media posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

---

## 📝 Project Description

This project combines **text sentiment analysis** with **financial stock data** to predict potential movements in stock prices. It leverages NLP techniques to extract sentiment scores from financial news headlines and social media posts. These scores are then used alongside historical stock data to train machine learning models for predictive forecasting.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Transformers (BERT)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📂 Dataset

- **`all-data.csv`**: Contains news headlines and associated sentiment labels.
  - Columns:
    - `Sentiment`: Label (`positive`, `negative`, `neutral`)
    - `Text`: News headline or social media post

You may optionally merge this dataset with stock data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage).

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and normalize text data
   - Remove stopwords and lemmatize words

2. **Sentiment Label Encoding**
   - Map `positive` → 1, `neutral` → 0, `negative` → -1

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF Vectorization of cleaned text
   - Optional: Use BERT for contextual sentiment features

4. **Model Training**
   - Train ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or BERT
   - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

5. **(Optional) Merge with Stock Data**
   - Combine sentiment scores with stock movement labels
   - Predict price movement using sentiment + historical trends

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- BERT (for advanced sentiment extraction)
- Optional: LSTM/GRU for time-series + sentiment prediction

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy / Precision / Recall / F1-score
- ROC-AUC (for binary prediction)

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use multiple sources of sentiment (news, Twitter, Reddit)
- Use BERT to get better contextual sentiment analysis
- Normalize stock price changes to binary labels (e.g., up/down)
- Add lag features and rolling averages for temporal smoothing
